# Tuition and Enrollment Project

Project goal was to observe trends in student tuition, enrollment and aid available for students. To achieve this, we have looked at data for the following fields starting from 1973 all the way up to 2017:

Tuition, Median Income, Student Aid, Wage Gap, Awarded Grants, Consumer Price Index, Student Aid Loans, and Enrollment Statistics.
